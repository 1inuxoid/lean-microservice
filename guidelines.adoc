We are still getting acquainted with the new stack and a lot of things are not set in stone yet. This document should
grow and evolve evolutionarily. The intention is to only document what has proven to be working (or not) in reality.
Hence, we/you write code, assess how it turns out, discuss with colleagues if you should do it differently and then
eventually the product team can document a recommended approach. Tear down those ivory towers, will you!

== General

Everything you ever learned about clean code and clean design still applies! If you want to do DDD then do DDD - just
on the lean stack.

=== Project structure, artifacts

* Write the _API resource_ classes manually in Kotlin; as immutable data classes. Generating from the service contract
with some Swagger/OpenAPI generator means blowing up `build.gradle` - and getting Java rather than Kotlin code.
Creating Kotlin data classes on the other hand is super quick and the (automatic) contract validation, more on that
later, ensures correctness of the code. Furthermore, those resources should mostly be POKOs.
* It's ok to generate other classes from contracts you depend upon.
* Put them into the `ch.ti8m.channelsuite.<module>.resources` package.
* Write dedicated entities if necessary and convert between the entities and resources.
* WARNING be very careful which representation of an object you use on which layer! It's quite likely that you will have
at least three representations of the same object:
  - API resource
  - entity
  - jOOQ record
 -> returning the jOOQ record inside the route for example is not ok

=== Contract validation

In order to validate that your module (its routes and resources)
https://channelsuite.ti8m.ch/docu/modules/service-contracts/latest/#add-validating-unit-test[fulfill the service contract]
a `SwaggerValidationIT` was generated. It will start the application on a random port and have the
https://jooby.org/doc/apitool/[Jooby ApiTool module] reverse engineer an OpenAPI contract from the implementation (what
Springfox does in the vintage world). The ApiTool is a fairly new module and its support for Kotlin is still improving.
It is likely that validation will fail with false positives because the APITool generated an incomplete or incorrect
Swagger file. Please report those issue on GitHub. They usually https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amarcelstoer+label%3Aapitool+[get fixed within days] or a few weeks.

== Kotlin

- Contrary to Java Kotlin allows to pack more than one top-level class into the same `.kt` file. It is suggested to use
that feature to group classes that are tightly coupled to each other and thus form a coherent unit. Ideally, the name
of the main class is the same as the filename - just like in Java. If you opt to put a larger unit into a single file
this should be reflected in the filename i.e. `FooBar<unit-type>`.
- It's ok for entities to inherit from data classes. However, since constructors are not inherited it offers no obvious
benefit over just repeating the same constructor (if useful) as in the data class.
- Understand that if you use string interpolation in log messages you are not profiting from the lazy evaluation your
logging framework offers: `logger.debug("Deleted $count children...` is just a nicer
`logger.debug("Deleted " + count + " children...`.


== Jooby

- Use script routes rather than MVC routes: https://jooby.org/doc/#routes[https://jooby.org/doc/#routes]
- Use the `JoobyRule` JUnit rule in your integration tests for starting/stopping the application: https://jooby.org/doc/#tests-integration-tests[https://jooby.org/doc/#tests-integration-tests]

== jOOQ

- You are likely going to inject a/the `DSLContext` into the persistence classes like repositories. Make sure it is
named appropriately. Calling it `create` will allow for the very elegant `create.newRecord(FOO)` but also for the very
odd `create.deleteFrom(FOO)`.
