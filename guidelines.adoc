We are still getting acquainted with the new stack and a lot of things are not set in stone yet. This document should
grow and evolve evolutionarily. The intention is to only document what has proven to be working (or not) in reality.
Hence, we/you write code, assess how it turns out, discuss with colleagues if you should do it differently and then
eventually the product team can document a recommended approach. Tear down those ivory towers, will you!

== General

Everything you ever learned about clean code and clean design still applies! If you want to do DDD then do DDD - just
on the lean stack.

=== Project structure, artifacts

.Writing vs. generating classes for API
* Write the _API resource_ classes manually in Kotlin; as immutable data classes. Generating from the service contract
with some Swagger/OpenAPI generator means blowing up `build.gradle` - and getting Java rather than Kotlin code.
Creating Kotlin data classes on the other hand is super quick and the (automatic) contract validation, more on that
later, ensures correctness of the code. Furthermore, those resources should mostly be POKOs. See example in the
xref:api-resources[Kotlin section].
* It's ok to generate _other_ classes (i.e. not the API resources) from contracts you depend upon.
* Put the API resource classes into the `ch.ti8m.channelsuite.<module>.resources` package.

.Resources and entities
Write dedicated entities if necessary and convert between these entities and resources.

.One type per layer
Be very careful which representation of an object you use on which layer! It's quite likely that you will have at least
three representations of the same object:
* API resource
* entity
* jOOQ record

Returning the jOOQ record inside the route for example is not ok. Use resources in the "controllers", entities for
persistence and jOOQ records inside the repository implementations.

=== Contract validation

In order to validate that your module (its routes and resources)
https://channelsuite.ti8m.ch/docu/modules/service-contracts/latest/#add-validating-unit-test[fulfill the service contract]
a `SwaggerValidationIT` was generated. It will start the application on a random port and have the
https://jooby.org/doc/apitool/[Jooby ApiTool module] reverse engineer an OpenAPI contract from the implementation (what
Springfox does in the vintage world). The ApiTool is a fairly new module and its support for Kotlin is still improving.
It is likely that validation will fail with false positives because the APITool generated an incomplete or incorrect
Swagger file. Please report those issue on GitHub. They usually https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amarcelstoer+label%3Aapitool+[get fixed within days] or a few weeks.

== Kotlin

.Multiple classes per file
Contrary to Java Kotlin allows to pack more than one top-level class into the same `.kt` file. It is suggested to use
that feature to group classes that are tightly coupled to each other and thus form a coherent unit. Ideally, the name
of the main class is the same as the filename - just like in Java. Example: (simplified) `ExchangeRate.kt`
[source,kotlin]
----
data class ExchangeRate(val tiers: List<ExchangeRateTier>) #<1>

data class ExchangeRateTier(val amount: BigDecimal) #<2>
----

<1> `ExchangeRate` is the main class and, therefore, the file is called `ExchangeRate.kt`
<2> `ExchangeRateTier` isn't used anywhere without its parent, hence it's in the same file (similar to nested classes in
Java)

If you opt to put a larger unit into a single file this should be reflected in the filename i.e. `FooBar<unit-type>`. In
the above example there _is_ no larger unit.

[[api-resources]]
.API resources
An example that documents a few points discussed above and more.
[source,kotlin]
----
data class ExchangeRate(@JsonFormat(pattern = rfc3339Pattern) #<1>
                        val timestamp: ZonedDateTime, #<2>
                        val type: String,
                        val unit: BigDecimal,
                        val tiers: List<ExchangeRateTier>)

data class ExchangeRateTier(val amountTo: BigDecimal,
                            val bid: BigDecimal,
                            val mid: BigDecimal,
                            val ask: BigDecimal)
----

<1> OpenAPI timestamps are required to be RFC3339 compliant, a format for which Jackson has no constant yet. So, you
have to define `"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss[.S]XXX"` somewhere yourself.
<2> All properties are mandatory in this case and the class is immutable

.Resource->entity inheritance
It's ok for entities to inherit from data classes. However, since constructors are not inherited it offers no obvious
benefit over just repeating the same constructor (if useful) as in the data class. Immutability is a desirable trait
here as well.

.String interpolation / logging
Understand that if you use string interpolation in log messages you are not profiting from the lazy evaluation your
logging framework offers: `logger.debug("Deleted $count children...` is just a nicer
`logger.debug("Deleted " + count + " children...`.


== Jooby

.Routes
Use script routes rather than MVC routes: https://jooby.org/doc/#routes[https://jooby.org/doc/#routes]. Use a constant
for the API version as the first URL segment (â†’ https://channelsuite.ti8m.ch/docu/modules/service-contracts/latest/#versioning[guidelines])
[source,kotlin]
----
class StateRoutes : Kooby({ #<1>
    path(apiVersion) {
        path("/state") {
            path("/topics") {
                get {
                    getProcessingInfoForTopicOrAll(null)
                }

                path("/:topicName") {
                    get {
                        val topicName = param<String>("topicName")
                        val topicStates = getProcessingInfoForTopicOrAll(topicName)
                        if (topicStates.isEmpty()) throw Err(Status.NOT_FOUND) else topicStates
                    }

                    post { req, resp ->
                        val topicName = req.param<String>("topicName")
                        val startParam = req.param("start").toOptional()
                        val stopParam = req.param("stop").toOptional()
----

<1> It's quite likely you will organize your routes by "topic" or resources (e.g. one file for `Person`, one for
`Offer`, etc.)

.Integration tests
Use the `JoobyRule` JUnit rule in your integration tests for starting/stopping the application: https://jooby.org/doc/#tests-integration-tests[https://jooby.org/doc/#tests-integration-tests]

== jOOQ

- You are likely going to inject a/the `DSLContext` into the persistence classes like repositories. Make sure it is
named appropriately. Calling it `create` will allow for the very elegant `create.newRecord(FOO)` but also for the very
odd `create.deleteFrom(FOO)`.
